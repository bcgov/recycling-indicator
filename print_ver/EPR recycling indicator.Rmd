* In 2007, British Columbia adopted the [Extended Producer Responsibility Program](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/waste-management/recycling/product-stewardship). This policy approach tasks into account the whole life cyle of a product and highlights the producers responsibility for reducing environmental impacts. 

* To add : Key messages ; 
  +  EPR program saves on landfill space, 
  + financial data = jobs , 
  + commodities go baack into the economy 


* We assessed regional and provincial trends in recyling across B.C, using publically available available annual reporting data. We quantified recycling per kilogram per person (kg.per.person) for the following recycling types; **Beverages** (2007-2017), **Electrical** (Major Appliance recycling: 2015-2017, Batteries (2010 - 2017), Canadian Electrical Stewardship Association (2011- 2017)), **Pharmaceutical** (2008 - 2017), **Oil** (filters, containers, antifreeze ) and **Pulp and Paper** (2015-2017).  


\newpage 

* The amount of recyled material varied greatly with type of material. The greatest material recycled (kg per person) was pulp and paper, while consumable materials ranged from very low (Pharmaceutical)to high (Oil)


* In general the amount of material recycled increased over time, irrespective of the number of years of data available.

## Regional Recycling across B.C. 


```{r plot1, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Recycling per type for all years of available data (kgs per person) ", results = 'asis', out.width='0.95\\linewidth', fig.align = 'center'}

```


```{r map1, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = " Total beverage recycling per region (2008-2017)", results = 'asis', out.width='0.95\\linewidth', fig.align = 'center'}

```

*See appendices for details on regional trends per recyling type.

## Cost of recycling 

Across the province the cost to recycle a tonne of material varied per produce with lowest cost assigned to pulp and paper. The longest record of recycling was the beverage containers which has remained steady over the last 10 years around $1,500 per tonne of containers.  


```{r, plot3, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Cost per tonne of recycling material ($1000)" ,  out.width='0.95\\linewidth', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("cost.per.tonne.png")

```


\newpage 

## Methods 

* We combined raw annual amounts of recycling (tonnes or kg) for all available datasets with Population data obtained by [Stats Can](https://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/apps/PopulationEstimates.aspx). We included only weighed measure, ie. all estimated values were excluded from the analysis. 

* Where more than one company reported data on a particular recycling type, values were combined. This included beverage (Encorp Pacific, BC Brewers Recycles Collection Council) 

* Regional districts were combined where data was reported
