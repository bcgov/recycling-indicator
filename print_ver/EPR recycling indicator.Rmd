* In 2007, British Columbia adopted the [Extended Producer Responsibility Program](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/waste-management/recycling/product-stewardship). This evironmental policy approach taskes into account the whole life cyle of a product and highlights the producers responsibility for reducing environmental impact. 


* Key messages ; 
  +  EPR program saves on landfill space, 
  + financial data = jobs , 
  + commodities go baack into the economy 


* Companies are required to report annual on the amount of recycled material producted and associates cost. [Add links]

* We assessed regional trends in recycled materials across B.C. where comparable data was available. Recycling data (kg per person) was available for the following material types: Beverage (2007-2017) , Electrical (Major Appliance recycling: 2015-2017, Batteries (2010 - 2017), Canadian Electrical Stewardship Association (2011- 2017)), Pharmaceutical (2008 - 2017), Oil (filters, containers, antifreeze ) and PPP (packaging, printed, paper (2015-2017)).

knitr::include_graphics("regional.kg.cap.facet.png")

```


* The amount of recyled material varied greatly with type of material. The greatest material recycled was packaging and printed paper, while consumable types were very low (Pharmaceutical) to high (oil and filters), with unusual results. 

* Trending over time were compared for beverage and electronics

## Regional Recycling across B.C. 

We compared recycling amounts (kg per person) for the regional districts across B.C. This included beverage recycling (2007 - 2017),  
oil, filters, containes (2010 - 2017) * note these were pre calculated based on per person 

electric (CESA, batteries (2010 - 2017), MMR (2015-2017))




Each year companies report on total amount (tonnes) recyclied for each regional district.

```{r plot2, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Recycling per Region (kgs per person) ", results = 'asis', out.width='0.95\\linewidth', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("regional.kg.cap.facet.png")

```


## Cost of recycling 

Across the province the cost to recycle a tonne of material varied per produce with lowest cost assigned to electrical (MMR), . The longest record of recycling was the Beverage containers which has remained steady over the last 10 years around $1,500 per tonne of containers.  



```{r, plot2, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Cost per tonne of recycling material ($1000)" ,  out.width='0.95\\linewidth', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("cost.per.tonne.png")

```


# Methods 

We combined annual reporting figures available for the following producers (beverage containers) 


Beverage containers 

Containers were collected from multiple groups: Encorp Pacific (Canada), BC Brewers Recycles Collection Council. Both of these datasets contained metrics on the units collected, weight collection (tonnes) with population data from 2006 - 2017. There is also some financial data ( revenue/ expenditure /deposits charged / units moved) and other (CO2 Equivalent Reduced (tonnes), weight of material).

Data exploration points to consider:
•Regional and financial data grouped for Encorp and BCBRCC
•BCBRC collection year time period differs (i.e. 2007/08, 2008/09,2009/10) with some data reported per financial years (March 31st). In these cases data was assigned to preceeding year.
•Some data anomolied in Central Coast and Central Kootneys in 2015 were verified in pdf reports and found to be same as pdf report.
